//Make sure that the correct user is moving

Make the user leave the room at the end of the game - add a forfeit button

//Make it so that a room name becomes the link for the room
    - This is instead of all rooms being in "/game" and rooms being stored only in session data
    - Using this link people should be able to join as spectators - even not logged in
    - Might be able to do this with "/<int:id>" or something? That may only be for ints may like 
      "/<roomname>" or something of that sort

//Make it so that the game state is stored on the server for the room, and that refreshing
the page makes it so that you get back the same game, rather than it resetting on one of
the clients as this causes errors anyway
    - Probably need to define a way to parse the board to create an fen and store that fen in a
      database or maybe even in a variable where the key is the room name, then use the fen of
      the room to call the NewGame function to get the board right, seems like the simplest way to
      do it to me atm
