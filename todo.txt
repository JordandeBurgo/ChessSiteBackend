//Make sure that the correct user is moving

Make the user leave the room at the end of the game - add a forfeit button
    - Got a disconnect function running and how to see who is disconnecting, can use this to
      check if both *playing* clients have disconnected, if they have boot everyone (spectators)
      out the room and delete room data from redis. Perhaps keep a "connected users" key in redis
      for this

//Add something that makes it obvious whos turn it is
    - At the moment I am thinking have 2 html elements that are just squares at the top and bottom
      of the board, when a user makes a move the one square becomes hidden and the other becomes
      visible

Add end of game popup

//Make it so that a room name becomes the link for the room
    - This is instead of all rooms being in "/game" and rooms being stored only in session data
    - Using this link people should be able to join as spectators - even not logged in
    - Might be able to do this with "/<int:id>" or something? That may only be for ints may like 
      "/<roomname>" or something of that sort

//Make it so that the game state is stored on the server for the room, and that refreshing
the page makes it so that you get back the same game, rather than it resetting on one of
the clients as this causes errors anyway
    - Probably need to define a way to parse the board to create an fen and store that fen in a
      database or maybe even in a variable where the key is the room name, then use the fen of
      the room to call the NewGame function to get the board right, seems like the simplest way to
      do it to me atm

Add menu that allows you to choose "Local v Human, Local v Bot, or Online Human v Human"
    - The bot doesnt exist yet but that's a plan for the future

Add game timer - and the ability to choose time control on creating a game

Make it so that there is a list of online users
    - Ability to add friends
    - Ability to challenge other online users
    - Ability to view challenges

Make it so challenges create random rooms rather than the user choosing a room name

Confirm email address for signup

Play a sound on a move + possibly add an animation for if you didnt drag/recieved a move

Be able to view previous boards, but bring back to the actual board and only able to play on actual
board

Flip board capability - autoflip for black - seeingly simple but actually A LOT of work

Make sure that the move from the client is valid on the server

Add list of people in room to html
