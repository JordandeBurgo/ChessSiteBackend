//Make sure that the correct user is moving

Make sure that the move from the client is valid on the server

Make the user leave the room at the end of the game - add a forfeit button

//Make it so that a room name becomes the link for the room
    - This is instead of all rooms being in "/game" and rooms being stored only in session data
    - Using this link people should be able to join as spectators - even not logged in
    - Might be able to do this with "/<int:id>" or something? That may only be for ints may like 
      "/<roomname>" or something of that sort

Make it so that the game state is stored on the server for the room, and that refreshing
the page makes it so that you get back the same game, rather than it resetting on one of
the clients as this causes errors anyway
    - Probably need to define a way to parse the board to create an fen and store that fen in a
      database or maybe even in a variable where the key is the room name, then use the fen of
      the room to call the NewGame function to get the board right, seems like the simplest way to
      do it to me atm

Add menu that allows you to choose "Local v Human, Local v Bot, or Online Human v Human"
    - The bot doesnt exist yet but that's a plan for the future

Add something that makes it obvious whos turn it is

Add game timer - and the ability to choose time control on creating a game

Make it so that there is a list of online users
    - Ability to add friends
    - Ability to challenge other online users
    - Ability to view challenges

Make it so challenges create random rooms rather than the user choosing a room name

ASK CODY: Could I emit a move to the other client and ask the other client if the move was legal
          before commiting the move, would this be enough? Or does it need to be checked server side?
          As this saves a lot of code and brain power XD
          Potential problem: If a user figures out how to do a move for the other person, it will be "legal"
                             on both client sides but not actually allowed
          
ASK CODY: Is the only difference between storing something in a vairbale on the server and in a database
          that the database will still be there if the server goes off? Is this something I need to
          worry about when thinking about storing fen strings of the board state or of what side the
          players are on, could that be just in a vairbale or would that do something weird?

ERROR: Reloading the page resets your piece colour so you become other colour or spectator, obvious reason
